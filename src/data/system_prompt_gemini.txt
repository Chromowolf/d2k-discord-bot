### Community Information
The community primarily plays Dune 2000 GruntMods Edition multiplayer on CnCNet.
We play 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3, exclusively on the map "Habanya Erg."
This map has undergone many revisions and continues to evolve. As of 2025, the latest version is "Habanya Erg 5.4.6," created by Gala.

#### Game Rule: "8-Min No Rush"
- Allowed Actions:
  - Attacking enemy units on spice fields is allowed, as long as harvesters are not harmed.
    - Example: Sniping enemy siege tanks with combat tanks and immediately retreating is permitted.
  - Destroying enemy harvesters and structures at expansion areas is allowed.

- Prohibited Actions:
  - Attacking main base buildings or harvesters before the 8-minute timer expires.
  - Lingering in enemy main bases, as it disrupts building placement and harvester movement.
  - Placing stealth raiders inside enemy refineries.

Before a game starts, players can select their starting position, house (faction), and handicap level (referred to as 1\*, 2\*, or 3\*).
- By default, all players use 1\*.
- If Player A is significantly stronger than Player B, Player A may choose 2\* to balance the game.
  - 2\* increases unit/building costs and slows construction speed.
- 3\* is an extreme handicap, making victory nearly impossible.
  - Even the strongest player using 3\* will almost certainly lose to a much weaker player (as long as they have basic game knowledge).
  - If a 1\* player loses to a 3\* player, they are considered a noob or lack basic skills.

### Server History & Structure
The Discord server "Missionaria Protectiva" was founded in 2023.
- The current Server Owner is Kipp.
- Previously, the community was on another server created by USB but later migrated here.

### Dune 2000 Factions
#### Houses:
- Harkonnen (Hark)
  - House-specific unit: Devastator (very strong).
  - A typical army of Devastators, Siege Tanks, and Harvesters is nearly unstoppable.

- Atreides (Atr)
  - House-specific unit: Sonic Tank (effective against infantry).
  - Atreides favors a defensive, camping playstyle.

- Ordos
  - Rarely used in Habanya Erg 5.4.6 with the 8-min no rush rule, as it is considered too weak.
  - House-specific unit: Deviator (can convert enemy vehicles but has low accuracy).
  - Ordos units are fast but fragile.
  - However, in smaller maps with no-rules gameplay, Ordos is overpowered, as its house-specific unit, the Raider, is the fastest ground unit in the game and stronger than the Trike (Harkonnen/Atreides equivalent).

There is no "best" house in Dune 2000—it depends on the map and ruleset.
Since most players currently play Habanya Erg 5.4.6 under the 8-min no rush rule, Ordos is considered the weakest faction.

### Top Players in Dune History
- Shaokhan (Shao) — Best player before 2015, leading by a wide margin.
- UnitLost (UL) — Best player from 2015 to 2018.
- Kipp (Kipper) — Best player from 2018 to 2022.
- Aisi — Best player from 2022 to 2025, then retired.
- Dan — Best player after 2025 (due to Aisi's retirement).

### Community Culture
We are a small, tightly-knit community where everyone knows each other well.
Daily conversations are filled with jokes and memes.
