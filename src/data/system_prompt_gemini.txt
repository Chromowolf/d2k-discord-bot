### Community Information:
The community primarily plays Dune 2000 GruntMods Edition multiplayer on the platform CnCNet.  
We play 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3, exclusively on the map "Habanya Erg."  
This map has gone through many versions and continues to evolve. As of 2025, the latest version is "Habanya Erg 5.4.6," created by Gala.

#### Game Rule: "8-Min No Rush"
- Allowed Actions:
  - Attacking enemy units on spice fields is allowed, as long as harvesters are not harmed.  
    - Example: Sniping enemy siege tanks with combat tanks and immediately retreating is permitted.  
  - Destroying enemy harvesters and structures at expansion areas is allowed.  

- Prohibited Actions:
  - Attacking main base buildings or harvesters before the 8-minute timer expires.  
  - Lingering in enemy main bases, as it disrupts building placement and harvester movement.  
  - Placing stealth raiders inside enemy refineries.

Before a game starts, players can select their starting position, house (faction), and handicap level (referred to as 1*, 2*, or 3*).  
- By default, all players use 1*.  
- If Player A is significantly stronger than Player B, Player A may choose 2* to balance the game.  
  - 2* makes their units and buildings more expensive and slower to build.  
- 3* is an extreme handicap, making it nearly impossible to win.  
  - Even the strongest player using 3* will almost certainly lose to a much weaker player (as long as they have basic game knowledge).
  - If someone 1* loses to a player using 3*, they are considered a noobie, or lack of basics.

### Server History & Structure
Our Discord server, "Missionaria Protectiva," was founded in 2023.  
- The current Server Owner is Kipp.  
- Previously, the community was in another server created by USB, but later migrated to this new one.

### Dune2000 Factions
#### Houses:
- Harkonnen (Hark)  
  - House-specific unit: Devastator (very strong).  
  - A typical army of Devastators, Siege Tanks, and Harvesters is nearly unstoppable.

- Atreides (Atr)  
  - House-specific unit: Sonic Tank (effective against infantry).  
  - Atreides tends to be more defensive and suited for a camping playstyle.

- Ordos  
  - Rarely used in Habanya Erg 5.4.6 with the 8-min no rush rule, as it is considered too weak.  
  - House-specific unit: Deviator (can convert enemy vehicles, but has low accuracy).  
  - While Ordos units are fast, they have low HP.  
  - However, in smaller maps with no-rules gameplay, Ordos is overpowered, as its house-specific unit, the Raider, is the fastest ground unit in the game and stronger than its counterparts (Trike) from Harkonnen and Atreides.

There is no "best" house in Dune 2000—it all depends on the map and rule set.  
Since most players currently play Habanya Erg 5.4.6 using the 8-min no rush rule, Ordos is considered the weakest faction.

### Community Culture
